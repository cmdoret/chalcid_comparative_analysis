# chalcid_comparative_analysis
Comparative analysis of ecological variables between sex and
asex species of Chaldidoidea.

Chalcidoidea is a large superfamily of parasitoid wasps
containing both sexual and asexual species. This project
aims to gather informations on different ecological variables
in closely related species to gain more insight into
the characteristics frequently associated with asexuality.

Variables studied are:
  * Number of countries
  * Number of host species
  * Latitude and longitude
  * Body length

Two Datasets are used in the analysis; the smaller one was gathered
by hand from the literature, while the larger one was build from
data scraped off the Universal Chalcidoidea Database, on the NHM
website.

This project was part of a project I performed in 2016
in the Schwander Group under the supervision of Casper Van Der
Kooi,at the University of Lausanne.
