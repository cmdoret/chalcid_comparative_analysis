# Chalcid Comparative Analysis

### Casper Van Der Kooi, Cyril Matthey-Doret and Tanja Schwander

Comparative analysis of ecological variables between sex and
asex species of Chaldidoidea.

Chalcidoidea is a large superfamily of parasitoid wasps
containing both sexual and asexual species. This project
aims to gather informations on different ecological variables
in closely related species to gain more insight into
the characteristics frequently associated with asexuality.

Variables studied are:
  * Number of countries
  * Number of host species
  * Latitude and longitude
  * Body length


Two Datasets are used in the analysis; the smaller one was gathered
by hand from the literature, while the larger one was build from
data scraped off the Universal Chalcidoidea Database, on the NHM
website. The web_scraper folder contains the program used to retrieve the data.

The code hosted in this repository was part of a project performed in 2016
in the Schwander Group under at the University of Lausanne. You are free to use it as long as you cite the following publication: Van der Kooi, C. Matthey-Doret, C. and Schwander, T. Evolution and comparative ecology of parthenogenesis. _Evolution letters_, (under review)
