# Statistical analyses

This folder contains scripts and models used for comparisons between asexual and sexual species.

- auto_permutation_test.R : script used to compare asexual and sexual species in the automated dataset. In this script, we use a permutation approach with a generalized linear mixed model.
- manual_permutation_test.R : same script adapted for pairs in the smaller manual dataset.
- permut_causality_enhanced.R : based on the same principle, but for comparison between sexual species with an asexual sister species versus (manual dataset) other sexuals (automated dataset).
