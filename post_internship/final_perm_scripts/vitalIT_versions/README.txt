This folder contains updated versions of the scripts where pairs are nested in genera for manual dataset and Nbr-host and nbr-country are fit to the Poisson distrubution using a glm, whereas all other variables are fit to the normal distribution (using a lm). 

The pdf files are the output with 10'000 simulations. They contain visual representations of the distribution of the observed z/t values relative to those obtained with sumulations. The empirical p-values are also displayed. I made also made a csv table where I stored the pvalues for each variable at different cutoffs. 

GE stands for "greater or equal" while GT stands for "greater than"
